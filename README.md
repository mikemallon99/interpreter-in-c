# Monkey Interpreter implemented in C

This is a C implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter from the book Writing An Interpreter In Go by Thorsten Ball. I made this project in order to learn more about how to write good C code, and also to learn more about how programming languages work. I encourage others who are trying to write their own language interpreter in C to give this a look!
